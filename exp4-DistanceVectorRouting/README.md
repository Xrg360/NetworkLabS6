# Network Lab - Experiment: Distance Vector Routing

## Objective:
The objective of this experiment is to understand the principles and implementations of distance vector routing algorithms in computer networks.

## Experiment Overview:
In this experiment, we explore distance vector routing, a type of distributed routing algorithm used in computer networks. Distance vector routing algorithms enable routers to dynamically calculate the best path to reach a destination based on distance metrics.

## Experiment Procedure:
1. **Setup Network Topology:**
   - Create a network topology consisting of routers interconnected through links.
   
2. **Implement Distance Vector Routing Algorithm:**
   - Implement the distance vector routing algorithm on each router to calculate the shortest path to reach all destinations in the network.
   
3. **Exchange Routing Information:**
   - Simulate the exchange of routing information between neighboring routers to update their routing tables.
   
4. **Convergence and Stability:**
   - Monitor the convergence of the routing algorithm to ensure that all routers have consistent and stable routing tables.

5. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the distance vector routing algorithm in terms of convergence time, routing table size, and scalability under various network conditions.
