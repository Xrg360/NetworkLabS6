# Go-Back-N ARQ

This repository contains the implementation of the Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocol. The protocol ensures reliable data transmission between a client and a server over an unreliable network.

## Files

1. [`server.c`](https://github.com/Xrg360/networkLabS6/blob/master/exp3-SlidingWindowProtocols/goBack/server.c): This file contains the implementation of the server-side code for the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol.
2. [`client.c`](https://github.com/Xrg360/networkLabS6/blob/master/exp3-SlidingWindowProtocols/goBack/client.c): This file contains the implementation of the client-side code for the Go-Back-N ARQ protocol.
3. [`outputs`](https://github.com/Xrg360/networkLabS6/blob/master/exp3-SlidingWindowProtocols/goBack/outputs.md): This file contains the sample output generated by running the client and server programs.

## Usage

To use this implementation, follow these steps:

1. Compile the `server.c` file using the following command:
```bash
gcc server.c
```
2. Compile the `client.c` file using a C compiler.
```bash
gcc client.c
```
3. Run the server program first by executing the generated executable.
```bash
./a.out
```
4. Run the client program by executing the generated executable, providing the necessary inputs.
5. Observe the output in the console and refer to the [`outputs`](https://github.com/Xrg360/networkLabS6/blob/master/exp3-SlidingWindowProtocols/goBack/outputs.md) file for a sample output.
